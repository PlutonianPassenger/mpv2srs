A script for the MPV video player which automates the process of sentence mining / vocabulary mining from movies, TV shows and videos, enabling the end user to do so seamlessly as he/she watches it.  

The user presses a hotkey (by default F9) and uses the arrow keys to select a word from the on-screen subtitles.  It takes a screenshot of the video and creates an MP3 file of the sound being played during the time the subtitle is on screen.

Then it appends the word, the image and the audio file to a TSV which can then be imported into Spaced Repetition Flashcard apps like Anki.  (The user can use ChatGPT/other LLM's to obtain translations of the words).  

I consider this a spiritual successor to the Subs2SRS app (which was abandoned many years ago) except here the user only picks the words he/she does not know or would like to review instead of every subtitle line in the film/episode/video.
